Lone Tape Case Study: Logistic Regression for Loan Default Prediction

This project involves building a logistic regression model to predict loan defaults using real-world loan data. The analysis covers:

Business Insights & EDA: Detailed exploratory data analysis, uncovering critical factors influencing loan defaults, such as loan duration, grade, and homeownership status.
Modeling: Developed a logistic regression model with a strong AUC-ROC score of 0.90 and Precision-Recall AUC of 0.76, indicating robust predictive performance.
Evaluation Metrics: Assessed model accuracy through precision (92% for non-defaults, 58% for defaults) and recall (88% for non-defaults, 68% for defaults).
Feature Engineering: Enhanced model efficiency by eliminating non-contributing features like employment length and interest rates.
Geographical & Temporal Analysis: Identified patterns in loan defaults across zip codes and years, highlighting areas and time periods with higher risk.
This repository includes the code, data, and detailed documentation for replicating the analysis and results.
